# Language Persistence Test

## Test Steps

1. **Initial Load**: Visit the website - should load in Tamil by default
2. **Language Toggle**: Click the language toggle button to switch to English
3. **Page Navigation**: Navigate to different pages (Products, About, Cart, etc.)
4. **Verify Persistence**: Language should remain English across all pages
5. **Browser Refresh**: Refresh the page - language should still be English
6. **Browser Restart**: Close and reopen browser - language should still be English
7. **Switch Back**: Toggle back to Tamil and verify it persists across pages

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Default language: Tamil
- ✅ Language selection persists across page navigation
- ✅ Language selection persists across browser refresh
- ✅ Language selection persists across browser restart
- ✅ Language toggle works on all pages
- ✅ All components respect the global language state

## Implementation Details

- Language state is managed globally via React Context
- Language preference is stored in localStorage
- All pages and components use the `useLanguage()` hook
- No more local language state in individual components
- Language provider wraps the entire app in layout.tsx
